# üîê Keystore Mismatch - Definitive Solution Guide

## ‚ùå The Problem
Google Play Console expects a specific signing certificate but you're using a different one.

**Expected by Google Play**: `SHA1: 4A:52:DE:2E:1B:7B:94:C7:6F:CB:89:B5:CA:4C:A1:27:3E:56:8B:17`  
**Your current keystore**: `SHA1: 9D:85:1D:03:AD:AE:CD:34:22:4C:F8:7D:45:E5:39:25:A3:F5:31:EB`

## üîç Root Cause
You previously uploaded a version of your app signed with a different keystore that you no longer have access to.
