## üíª Code Highlights

### Camera Integration with Capacitor
```javascript
async function capturePhoto() {
    const image = await Camera.getPhoto({
        quality: 90,
        allowEditing: false,
        resultType: 'dataUrl',
        source: CameraSource.Camera
    });
    displayImage(image.dataUrl);
}
```

### AI API Integration with Error Handling  
```javascript
async function identifyAnimal() {
    try {
        showLoading();
        const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/identify`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ 
                image: currentImage,
                timestamp: Date.now()
            })
        });
        const result = await response.json();
        displayResults(result);
    } catch (error) {
        showError('Identification failed. Please try again.');
    }
}
```

### Responsive Mobile-First Design
```css
.upload-container {
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.15);
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 15px 35px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```
