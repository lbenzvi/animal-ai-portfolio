# Samsung Galaxy Deployment Guide

## Overview
Your Animal AI app has been optimized specifically for Samsung Galaxy devices. The app now includes device restrictions, optimized builds, and Samsung-specific features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Android Configuration (`android/app/build.gradle`)
- **Minimum SDK**: Raised from 23 to 26 (Android 8.0) for better Samsung compatibility
- **ABI Splitting**: Separate APKs for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` architectures
- **Samsung Optimization**: Removed conflicting NDK filters to support proper ABI splitting

### 2. AndroidManifest.xml Updates
- **Device Restrictions**: Added screen size and hardware requirements
- **Camera Requirements**: Required camera with optional autofocus
- **Samsung Features**: Added Samsung hardware camera detection
- **Samsung Metadata**: Added Samsung Galaxy optimization flag

### 3. Runtime Device Detection (`MainActivity.java`)
- **Manufacturer Check**: Validates Samsung manufacturer
- **Model Verification**: Checks for Galaxy device models (SM-G*, SM-N*, SM-A*, SM-F*, SM-S*)
- **User Notification**: Shows dialog for unsupported devices and exits app

### 4. Google Play Store Configuration
- **Device Filter**: XML configuration for Samsung device targeting
- **Play Console Instructions**: Detailed setup guide for device restrictions

2. **Requirements**:
   - Minimum Android 8.0
   - Camera required

### Option 2: Separate APKs
Upload both APK files for different architectures:

- `app-armeabi-v7a-release-unsigned.apk` for older devices

## Device Compatibility

### Fully Compatible
- Galaxy S20, S21, S22, S23, S24 series

### Not Compatible
- Non-Samsung devices (blocked at runtime)
- Samsung tablets (can be enabled if needed)
- Very old Galaxy devices below Android 8.0

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on real Samsung devices** across different series (S, A, Note)
2. **Verify device detection** works correctly
3. **Test camera functionality** on various Galaxy models
4. **Confirm AI backend** works properly with Samsung camera outputs

## Production Deployment

### Before Publishing:
1. Sign APKs with your release keystore
2. Test on multiple Samsung Galaxy devices
3. Upload to Google Play Console internal track first
4. Configure device restrictions in Play Console
5. Gradually roll out to production

### Play Console Device Filter:
```
Manufacturer: Samsung
Device Models: SM-G*, SM-N*, SM-A*, SM-F*, SM-S*
Min Android: 8.0 (API 26)

```

## Notes
- **Universal APK disabled**: Prevents installation on non-Samsung devices
- **Runtime blocking**: App exits on non-Galaxy devices
- **Optimized builds**: Separate APKs for different architectures reduce file size
- **Samsung features**: App can detect Samsung-specific camera features

Your app is now ready for Samsung Galaxy-specific deployment!
